This repository contains replication [data](https://github.com/SC-COSMO/covid_vaccination_disparities/tree/main/data) and [code](https://github.com/SC-COSMO/covid_vaccination_disparities/tree/main/code) for our [pre-print manuscript](https://github.com/SC-COSMO/covid_vaccination_disparities/blob/main/Vax-Disparities-Appendix.pdf).

President Biden has announced that all adults aged 16 years and older will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, 2021. Under this expanded eligibility, demand for vaccination will continue to outstrip supply over the coming weeks, and unequal vaccination rates across racial/ethnic groups may compound existing disparities in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic communities.

Our manuscript describes our national and state-level projections of racial/ethnic disparities in vaccine coverage through July 1, 2021 given continuation of differential uptake across groups, as well as the potential impacts of strategies to reduce these disparities. One contribution of our analysis is to derive relative vaccination uptake rates across racial/ethnic groups from vaccination data reported by states, adjusting for differential eligibility relating to demographic differences, to capture the combined effects of disparities in vaccination accessibility and vaccine acceptance. Projecting vaccination coverage under persistence of current uptake rates, we found that Black and Hispanic populations would reach 75% coverage among adults one month later than White populations. In alternative scenarios, we found that interventions to equalize uptake rates across racial/ethnic groups could narrow but not erase these gaps, and that geographic targeting of vaccine doses to disadvantaged communities may be needed to produce a more equitable convergence of coverage by July.
